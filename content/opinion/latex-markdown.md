A few years ago,
I acquired a solid grasp of LaTeX's fundamentals and have exclusively used it for my papers ever since.
Opting in for LaTeX was one of the best technical writing decisions I've made,
particularly when it comes to writing those papers.
I hate using Word because I have a tendency to continually adjust the formatting and appearance of my documents,
and I find it difficult to leave them in draft mode.
Although some people suggest deferring formatting until the end,
I cannot bring myself to do so.
For other document types,
I eventually turned to simpler formats,
such as Markdown,
as Markdown is a highly flexible and open format,
and in cases where I don't need features from LaTeX,
I will always choose to write documents in Markdown.

Prior to using Markdown,
I didn't fully grasp its potential benefits.
I viewed it merely as a style commonly used on sites like Reddit or other forums,
and I wasn't a fan of the syntax.
However,
after I started using Obsidian and Hugo,
I accepted its greatness.

Both LaTeX and Markdown offer the advantage of using a similar technical writing style.
Personally,
I prefer to write each sentence on a new line,
breaking them further after a comma or when referencing parts of books or papers.
This approach has proven useful when using Git as a backup for my work,
as each line can be compared independently,
allowing for a more thorough analysis of changes than if the entire paragraph were written on a single line.
I also do this for these blog posts,
they are all written in Markdown,
and You can see the concept [here]().

Markdown is not only useful for technical writing but also a valuable tool for generating throwaway text.
I often use it for writing learning materials for exams or anything that I simply need to print,
where formatting is not a concern.
With pandoc,
it is easy to compile Markdown documents into PDFs,
similar to how you would with LaTeX.
While Markdown can be used in a manner similar to LaTeX for writing papers,
you may encounter a different set of issues that are specific to Markdown.
For instance,
Markdown lacks the more advanced options available in LaTeX,
such as mathematical and scientific tools.
However,
if you don't need to write complex papers in natural science fields,
Markdown is just as effective as LaTeX in that aspect.

Like many other writing environments,
neither LaTeX nor Markdown are inherently optimized for writing in languages other than English,
or the ones that do not have the same characters as English.
However,
there are ways to adapt both of them to accommodate different languages.

For LaTeX,
I would recommend using XeLaTeX instead,
as it is better configured by default to handle foreign languages.
This can save you a considerable amount of time when working with non-English languages.
On the other hand,
Markdown is more versatile in this regard,
as it allows for easy use of special characters and is not tied to any particular language.

One of the biggest challenges with LaTeX is its steep learning curve.
It can take some time to become familiar with the syntax and how the tool works.
However,
the effort is well worth it in the end.
In my experience,
using LaTeX has saved me time and frustration compared to using Word with its inconsistent formatting.
One of the best things about LaTeX is that once you have created a document,
it is extremely unlikely to change on its own between compilations unless you intentionally modify it.
While some of the features in LaTeX can be replicated in Word,
its elegance and flexibility never could.

Word is designed to cater to the needs of a broad range of users.
This approach means that those of us who do not require the majority of its features are left with an imperfect writing environment.
In contrast,
LaTeX and Markdown have a more bottom-up philosophy,
allowing users to learn and use only the features they need.
You can create a personalized template document that suits your requirements and use it consistently.
On the other hand,
my documents also load instantly,
and they often compile in less time than it would take a Word document to open on the same machines,
especially if they are larger.
